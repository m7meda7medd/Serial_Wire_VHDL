# Serial_Wire_VHDL
This project implements a serial data receiver in VHDL. It decodes serial data transmitted bit-by-bit, performs parity checks for error detection, and validates the stop bit to ensure data integrity. The received data is then output as a 7-bit vector, along with error and validity signals.
